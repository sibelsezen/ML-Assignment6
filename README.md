Consider the attached Car dataset from the UCI machine learning repository:   
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation. The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information directly relates CAR to the six input attributes:
buying: buying price
maint: price of the maintenance
doors: number of doors
persons: capacity in terms of persons to carry
lug_boot: the size of luggage boot
safety: estimated safety of the car
Attribute Information:
Class Values: unacc, acc, good, vgood
Attributes:
buying: vhigh, high, med, low.
maint: vhigh, high, med, low.
doors: 2, 3, 4, 5more.
persons: 2, 4, more.
lug_boot: small, med, big.
safety: low, med, high.

Use 5-fold cross validation to evaluate the classification performance of a SVM classifier. Provide the confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, total accuracy, F1-score, Roc curve, and area under curve.
